                            <h3><u><i>Structure</i></u></h3>
                            <p>The structure of this podcast was that Brian first started off talking about clocks and how difficult it is to fix broken antique clocks. Then , he connects this to John McLemore, who restores antique clocks, and says that he asked John for help solving a murder. Then, we get some dialogue from John and Brian, who are talking on the phone. Brian asks John questions and they converse about S-town.</p>
                            
                       <h3><u><i>Who does the talking?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>First in this podcast, we get an introduction by Brian Reed. Then, John B. McLemore talks to Brian. Then we have Mary (John's mother), then Skyler. But for the most part, it is Brian and John talking about/investigating the murder.</p>                            

                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it scripted?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>Only the narration seemed scripted to me. The rest of it seems informal and flows very well and naturally, so it seems unscripted for the most part.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it based mostly on interviews?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>Yes - for the most part, Brian is asking John questions on the phone to figure out more about the murder. Brian also asks Skyler some questions at the end of the podcast.</p>
                        
                            <u><h3><i>What are the sound effects and music elements present?</i></h3></u>
                            
                            <p>I really enjoyed the sound effects in this podcast because they didn't feel overdone and felt perfect for the podcast and almost soothing. It didn't interfere with the speaking in the podcast at all/wasn't distracting. There was some calming background music during some of the talking. In between transitions, there was an airy sort of music playing in the background as well as some stringed instruments playing. There was also sounds of phones dialing (the dial tone), a piano playing, the sound of people talking in the background, and more.

                            <h3><u><i>Structure</i></u></h3>
                            <p>I found this podcast really intriguing from the start - what grabbed my attention was that Sarah was not a detective or investigator or anything like that. I was curious as to why she has been doing this, so this was a great hook to get me to keep listenign! This podcast has one story told week by week. Sarah Koenig starts with an introduction. She describes how hard it is to remember what you did in the past few days, which I could definitely relate to! After this introduction, Sarah jumps into some interviews (brief excerpts from them), then she explains Hae's story, then goes back to interviews. So, the structure seems to be a mix of narration and interview excerpts.</p>
                            
                       <h3><u><i>Who does the talking?</i></u></h3>
                            <p> Sarah Koenig does the primary amount of talking in this podcast. Other people who talk are Tyler, Sam, Elliot, Rabia, Saad, the Detective, Jay, and Adnan, and some others whom Sarah interviews.        
                               </p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it scripted?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>It seems like the Sarah's narrations were scripted but the interview responses felt unscripted and natural to me - there was hesitation, forethought, etc. to prove this to me. Sarah's questions seemed like she had put thought into them/that they had been scripted. The whole episode felt very natural and the conversation felt real, there was laughter, and it didn't come off as forced at all.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it based mostly on interviews?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>Yes - this podcast revolves around Sarah trying to find more information, so she asks several people who were associated with Hae questions to find more information. She also has some narrative sections, but the interviews were a crucial part of the podcast.</p>
                        
                            <u><h3><i>What are the sound effects and music elements present?</i></h3></u>
                            Sound effects present are people laughing in the back, people talking in the background, there is also some music playing in the background during Sarah's narration - it was light and nothing distracting. There was also music at the beginning and at the end. There was less music in this podcast than the others, but I enjoyed it as it was because it came off as more concise and compelling without a whole lot of music/sound effects.
