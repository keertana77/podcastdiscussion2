                            <h3><u><i>Structure</i></u></h3>
                            <p>The structure consisted of a few people initially talking and discussing the topic and providing knowledge about the topic of color. Then, it transitioned more of to two people having a conversation about color. It felt light and humorous while educational, rather than rigidly structured. It drifted from conversation to conversation</p>
                            
                       <h3><u><i>Who does the talking?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>There are different men and women speaking and switching off and discussing color - as the podcast progresses, one man does most of the asking question while another man answers them.</p>                            

                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it scripted?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>It does seem scripted, as the topic, questions, answers seem as if they have been thoughtfully planned out in advance.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it based mostly on interviews?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>   It has an interview sort of format at types, with one person asking a question and another person giving an answer, but it felt more conversational and informational to me and it seemed that the person was asking questions out of curiousity (rather than an interrogation), rather than a formal interview.</p>
                        
                            <u><h3><i>What are the sound effects and music elements present?</i></h3></u>
                            
                            <p>There were many sound effects during this podcast. There are sound effects at the beginning to transition into the interviews. These sound effects mesh the voices of different people saying "Welcome to Radiolab."  Throughout the podcast, there are songs, instruments playing (piano), dramatic music, eerie music, calming music, GPS navigation voice, a woman and a man singing that transitions into a chorus, music that increases in loudness when one speaker discusses loudness, and much more. It ends with a group of people singing.

                            <h3><u><i>Structure</i></u></h3>
                            <p>This podcast has a narrative structure, but it jumps  back and forth in time. It is about a soldier named Walter who has just returned from the war and Heidi is his therapist/caseworker who helps him deal with the aftermath of his return. She records the conversation she has with him. Then, five years pass and an investigator comes to Heidi's new job and starts to ask her questions about the Homecoming Initiative, which makes her nervous. Then, we jump back to her conversation with Walter. There are a lot of time jumps and gaps between the present and the past. </p>
                            
                       <h3><u><i>Who does the talking?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>                            
                                Heidi Bergman does most of the talking as she seems to be the main character. She also talks to other characters: Walter Cruz, Colin Belfast, Dara Eackles, and Thomas Carrasco.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it scripted?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>It is definitely scripted, as each character is played by an actor/actress, and the dialogue has been planned in advance. But it flowed smoothly and did not come off as rigid and scripted - it seemed natural and conversational. It all felt very real to me.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it based mostly on interviews?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>It seems like it - Heidi spends a lot of time asking Walter questions about his experience. When Heidi talks to the investigator, he asks her questions in an interrogative manner. It seems as if interviews are a crucial part of this podcast.</p>
                        
                            <u><h3><i>What are the sound effects and music elements present?</i></h3></u>
                                                        After the introduction, this podcast starts off with dramatic instrumental music and sirens in the background. Sound effects include background noise at a restaurant and plates clattering, people talking in the background over a phone conversation, a dog barking/making noise, songs, and more.
