                            <h3><u><i>Structure</i></u></h3>
                            <p>The structure of this podcast was that Brian first started off talking about clocks and how difficult it is to fix broken antique clocks. Then , he connects this to John McLemore, who restores antique clocks, and says that he asked John for help solving a murder. Then, we get some dialogue from John and Brian, who are talking on the phone. Brian asks John questions and they converse about S-town.</p>
                            
                       <h3><u><i>Who does the talking?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>First in this podcast, we get an introduction by Brian Reed. Then, John B. McLemore talks to Brian. Then we have Mary (John's mother), then Skyler. But for the most part, it is Brian and John talking about/investigating the murder.</p>                            

                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it scripted?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>Only the narration seemed scripted to me. The rest of it seems informal and flows very well and naturally, so it seems unscripted for the most part.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it based mostly on interviews?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>Yes - for the most part, Brian is asking John questions on the phone to figure out more about the murder. Brian also asks Skyler some questions at the end of the podcast.</p>
                        
                            <u><h3><i>What are the sound effects and music elements present?</i></h3></u>
                            
                            <p>I really enjoyed the sound effects in this podcast because they didn't feel overdone and felt perfect for the podcast and almost soothing. There was some calming background music during some of the talking. In between transitions, there was an airy sort of music playing in the background as well as some stringed instruments playing. There was also sounds of phones dialing (the dial tone),

                            <h3><u><i>Structure</i></u></h3>
                            <p>This podcast has a narrative structure, but it jumps  back and forth in time. It is about a soldier named Walter who has just returned from the war and Heidi is his therapist/caseworker who helps him deal with the aftermath of his return. She records the conversation she has with him. Then, five years pass and an investigator comes to Heidi's new job and starts to ask her questions about the Homecoming Initiative, which makes her nervous. Then, we jump back to her conversation with Walter. There are a lot of time jumps and gaps between the present and the past. </p>
                            
                       <h3><u><i>Who does the talking?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>                            
                                Heidi Bergman does most of the talking as she seems to be the main character. She also talks to other characters: Walter Cruz, Colin Belfast, Dara Eackles, and Thomas Carrasco.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it scripted?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>It is definitely scripted, as each character is played by an actor/actress, and the dialogue has been planned in advance. But it flowed smoothly and did not come off as rigid and scripted - it seemed natural and conversational. It all felt very real to me.</p>
                            
                             <h3><u><i>Is it based mostly on interviews?</i></u></h3>
                            <p>It seems like it - Heidi spends a lot of time asking Walter questions about his experience. When Heidi talks to the investigator, he asks her questions in an interrogative manner. It seems as if interviews are a crucial part of this podcast.</p>
                        
                            <u><h3><i>What are the sound effects and music elements present?</i></h3></u>
                                                        After the introduction, this podcast starts off with dramatic instrumental music and sirens in the background. Sound effects include background noise at a restaurant and plates clattering, people talking in the background over a phone conversation, a dog barking/making noise, songs, and more.
